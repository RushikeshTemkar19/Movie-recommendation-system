MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM - XAI PBL PROJECT
=====================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
-----------------
This project implements an Explainable AI (XAI) movie recommendation system that provides 
personalized movie suggestions with transparent explanations for why specific movies are 
recommended to users.

FEATURES
--------
- Content-based movie recommendations
- Explainable AI insights showing recommendation reasoning
- Interactive visualizations of recommendation patterns
- Support for multiple recommendation algorithms
- User preference analysis and profiling

TECHNICAL STACK
---------------
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations
- NumPy for numerical computations

DATASET
-------
The system uses movie datasets containing:
- Movie metadata (title, genre, year, ratings)
- User ratings and preferences
- Movie features for content-based filtering

KEY COMPONENTS
--------------
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Movie data cleaning and feature extraction
   - User preference analysis
   - Feature engineering for recommendation algorithms

2. Recommendation Engine
   - Content-based filtering
   - Collaborative filtering
   - Hybrid recommendation approaches

3. Explainable AI Module
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Recommendation reasoning visualization
   - User-friendly explanation generation

4. Evaluation Metrics
   - Recommendation accuracy
   - User satisfaction metrics
   - Explainability assessment

INSTALLATION & SETUP
--------------------
1. Install required Python packages:
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   jupyter notebook XAI_PBL.ipynb

3. Run all cells to execute the complete pipeline

USAGE
-----
1. Load the movie dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Train recommendation models
4. Generate recommendations for users
5. View explanations for recommendations
6. Analyze recommendation patterns through visualizations

EXPLAINABLE AI FEATURES
-----------------------
- Visual explanations of why movies are recommended
- Feature importance rankings
- Similarity analysis between recommended and liked movies
- Interactive plots showing recommendation reasoning

RESULTS
-------
The system successfully provides:
- Accurate movie recommendations
- Clear explanations for each recommendation
- Visual insights into user preferences
- Transparent AI decision-making process

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------
- Real-time recommendation updates
- Advanced deep learning models
- Multi-modal recommendation (text, images, audio)
- Enhanced explainability techniques
- Web-based user interface
